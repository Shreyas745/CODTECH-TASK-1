OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
### **Overview of the Sentiment Analysis Project**

---

#### **Objective**
The goal of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis model that classifies movie reviews as **positive** or **negative** based on their content. The IMDb dataset is used for training and evaluation, and the project demonstrates how to preprocess text data, build machine learning or deep learning models, and evaluate their performance.

---

### **Steps Involved**

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Use the IMDb Movie Reviews dataset, which contains 50,000 labeled movie reviews (25,000 for training and 25,000 for testing).
   - Reviews are labeled as 1 (positive sentiment) or 0 (negative sentiment).

2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Convert text reviews into a numerical format suitable for model input.
   - Use padding to ensure all sequences have a fixed length.
   - Explore two preprocessing methods:
     - **TF-IDF Vectorization** for classical machine learning.
     - **Embedding Layers** for deep learning models.

3. **Model Development**
   - **Classical Machine Learning**: Logistic Regression with TF-IDF features.
   - **Deep Learning**: LSTM model to handle sequential data, leveraging word embeddings for better context understanding.

4. **Training the Model**
   - Split the training data into a training and validation set.
   - Train the models using appropriate metrics:
     - **Accuracy** for overall performance.
     - **Precision, Recall, F1-Score** for detailed evaluation.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the models on the test dataset.
   - Compare the performance of the logistic regression and LSTM models to determine which approach is better.

### **Technologies and Tools**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Preprocessing**: `nltk`, `sklearn`
  - **Machine Learning**: `scikit-learn`
  - **Deep Learning**: `TensorFlow/Keras`
- **Dataset**: IMDb Movie Reviews dataset (provided by TensorFlow or Kaggle).

---

### **Key Results**
- A well-trained **LSTM model** typically achieves a test accuracy between **85-90%**, leveraging word order and contextual embeddings.
- The simpler **Logistic Regression model** with TF-IDF features may achieve around **80-88% accuracy**, depending on preprocessing.

---

### **Future Extensions**
1. **Fine-tuning**: Experiment with advanced models like BERT or GPT for better performance.
2. **Multi-class Sentiment Analysis**: Extend the project to classify reviews as "positive," "negative," or "neutral."
3. **Data Augmentation**: Use data augmentation techniques to increase the robustness of the model.
4. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model as a web application using Flask or FastAPI for real-world usage.
